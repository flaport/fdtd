def delta(F: Tensorlike) -> Tensorlike:
    """
    Compute the vector Laplace operator of a vector field F located on the faces

    The last dimension represents the x, y, and z components of the vector

    This implementation takes a vector field `F` as input and computes the
    vector Laplace operator of the field using the `bd` backend. The output
    vector field `delta_F` is located on the faces of the grid cells that are
    perpendicular to the x, y, and z axes. Note that this implementation assumes
    that the input vector field `F` is located on the faces of the grid cells
    that are perpendicular to the x, y, and z axes, which is consistent with the
    staggered grid used in fluid dynamics and electrodynamics.


    The `delta` function computes the vector Laplace operator of a vector field
    using the `div`, `grad`, `curl_edge_to_face`, and `curl_face_to_edge` functions. The
    `div` and `grad` functions compute the divergence and gradient of a vector
    field, respectively, using finite differences between the components of the
    vector field at different points in the grid cell. The output fields are
    located on the faces of the grid cells that are perpendicular to the x, y,
    and z axes, which is consistent with the staggered Yee grid.
    
    The field types are:

    - `F`: A vector field located on the edges of the grid cells (point field).
    - `phi`: A scalar field located on the grid points (cell-centered field).
    - `E`: A vector field located on the edges of the grid cells (point field).
    - `A`: A vector field located on the faces of the grid cells (surface
      field).
    - `H`: A vector field located on the edges of the grid cells (point field).
    - `delta_F`: A vector field located on the edges of the grid cells (point
    field).

    The `div` function computes the divergence of the vector field `F`, which
    results in a scalar field `phi` located on the grid points.

    The `grad` function computes the gradient of the scalar field `phi`, which
    results in a vector field `E` located on the edges of the grid cells.

    The `curl_edge_to_face` function computes the point curl of the vector field `F`,
    which results in a vector field `A` located on the faces of the grid cells.

    The `curl_face_to_edge` function computes the surface curl of the vector field
    `A`, which results in a vector field `H` located on the edges of the grid
    cells.

    Finally, the `delta_F` vector field is computed as the difference between
    the vector field `E` and the vector field `H`, both located on the edges of
    the grid cells.
    
    l4m4re: This makes sense. In the above code, it is the vector field A that
    is a surface field, while the vector field H is a point field.
    
    GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. In the above code, the vector field `A`
    is a surface field located on the faces of the grid cells, while the vector
    field `H` is a point field located on the edges of the grid cells. 

    The `curl_edge_to_face` function computes the point curl of the vector field `F`,
    which results in a vector field `A` located on the faces of the grid cells.
    The `curl_face_to_edge` function then computes the surface curl of the vector
    field `A`, which results in a vector field `H` located on the edges of the
    grid cells. 

    The resulting vector field `H` represents the curl of the vector field `F`
    at the edges of the grid cells that are perpendicular to the x, y, and z
    axes, and is defined on the edges of the grid cells, which are integer grid
    points.
