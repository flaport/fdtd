""" The FDTD LGrid

The grid is the core of the FDTD Library. It is where everything comes together
and where the biggest part of the calculations are done.

The LGrid class is under construction and is to become the grid for simulating a
new theory based on the vector LaPlace operator. It is not yet functional and
should become an alternative implementation of the existing Grid class in the
FDTD library, which is made for simulating the electromagnetic Maxwell
equations. The end goal of the project is to build a simulator for a new theory,
based on the existing electromagnetic simulation library FDTD of which this
project is a fork.

So, for now, the goal of the current project is to refactor / rework the
existing Grid class for the electromagnetic fields into a new Grid class for the
new theory. The first step of impelementing the new theory is to implement the
operators used and the update functions for the fields. 

Once these are working and tested, the next step is to implement the sources,
boundaries, detectors and objects. These will have to be adapted from their
electromagnetic counterparts to the new theory and have to be consistent with a
staggered Yee grid.

The new theory is based on the vector LaPlace operator and the discovery of the
quantum circulation constant k, with a value equal to c*c but a unit of
measurement in [m^2/s]. This is a new constant of nature and represents the
quantum circulation constant, kinematic viscocity or diffusivity of the medium:

    k = c*c = 8.987551787368176e+16 [m^2/s].

The fundamental equation of the new theory is the definition of the time
derivative of any given vector field within the superfluid medium:

    dF/dt = -k * delta(F),
    
where F is any given vector field, delta is the vector LaPlace operator and k is
the quantum circulation constant. 

Note that this definition only has units of measurement in meters and seconds
and thus it represents a fundamental equation of nature describing the
fundamental dynamics of space-time itself and is decoupled from the substance of
the medium, the latter being represented by mass density rho in the model.

We believe that one day this equation will be recognized as one of the biggest
scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century, because there simply is no
argument to be made against such a simple and straightforward application of the
vector Laplacian using only one single Universal constant: k.

The vector LaPlace operator is defined as follows:

    delta(F) = grad(div(F)) - curl(curl(F)),
    
where grad is the gradient operator, div is the divergence operator and curl is
the curl operator. However, during the implementation of this simulator, it was
found that because of the design of the staggered Yee grid, the curl operator
actually has to be split into two separate operators, one for the left handed
curl and one for the right handed curl, so we redefine the vector LaPlace as
follows:
    
    delta(F) = grad(div(F)) - curl_surface(curl_point(F)),
        
where curl_surface is the surface field curl operator and curl_point is the
point field curl operator.  

According to the Yee discretization algorithm, there are inherently two types of
fields on the grid: `E`-type point fields on integer grid locations and `H`-type
surface fields on half-integer grid locations.

The beauty of these interlaced coordinates is that they enable a very natural
way of writing the curl of the electric and magnetic fields: the curl of an
H-type surface field will be an E-type point field and vice versa.



This definitiion can be negated:

    - delta(F) = - grad(div(F)) + curl_surface(curl_point(F)),

And thus we can compute the time derivative of any given vector field F along:

    dF/dt = -k * delta(F) = -k * grad(div(F)) + k * curl_surface(curl_point(F)),

or:

    dF/dt = -k * delta(F) = k ( -grad(div(F)) + curl_surface(curl_point(F)) ),

which can be rewritten to an update equation for F:

    F += -k * delta(F) * dt = k ( -grad(div(F)) + curl_surface(curl_point(F)) )
    * dt,
    
with dt the time step of the simulation.

Using the definition of the vector LaPlace operator, we can define several
fields within one consistent framework. The most simple field to define is the
flow velocity vector field v, so we can compute it's time derivate, the
acceleration vector field a, as follows:

    a = dv/dt = -k * delta(v) = k ( -grad(div(v)) + curl_surface(curl_point(v))
    ).

This is known as the velocity diffusion equation and is the fundamental equation
of fluid dynamics.

And, by applying Newton's F=ma, we can define the 3D force density vector field
F as follows:

    F = rho * a = -k * rho * delta(v) = k * rho * (-grad(div(v)) +
    curl_surface(curl_point(v)) ).
    
One of the big benefits of the the fundamental equation of the new theory,
defining the time derivative of any given vector field F, is that we can now
apply this equation to the acceleration vector field a to compute the time
derivative of a, the jerk vector field j:

    j = da/dt = -k * delta(a) = k ( -grad(div(a)) + curl_surface(curl_point(a))
    ).
    
And, by applying Y=mj, with Yank the time derivative of Force, we van the 3D
yank density vector field Y as follows:  
    
    Y = rho * j = -k * rho * delta(a) = k * rho * (-grad(div(a)) +
    curl_surface(curl_point(a)) ).
            
Thus, we come to a higher order model incorporating not only acceleration and
force density vector fields, but also their time derivatives: the jerk and yank
density vector fields.

Note that we have used lower case for the v, a and j vector, contrary to the
convention of this library to denote vector fields with capital letters, because
these are commonly used symbols for velocity, acceleration and jerk.

This means that we have obtained a model that is superior to both Maxwell's
equations as well as Navier-Stokes equations, because it is a higher order
model. This has far reaching consequences for our understanding of physics and
the medium, because it is known that the intermediate fields we obtain by
writing out the definition of the vector LaPlace operator, are 100%
mathematically consistent and free of any paradoxes or inconsistencies. Also,
any wave equations that can be derived from this model will be invariant to the
Galilean coordinate transformation, bringing the Lorentz tranform on which
Einstein's theory of relativity is based, into question.

Furthermore, the introduction of the jerk and yank vector fields into the model
enables us to model the dynamics of the medium in a much more accurate way, as
from control systems theory it is known that not only the acceleration of an
actuator needs to be controlled, but also the jerk. Otherwise, all kinds of
vibrations and oscillations will occur in the system. 

In other words: since it is known from control systems that the jerk of the
system under control needs to be controlled as well, it is only logical that
this should be the case for the medium as well. And, since neither Maxwell's
equations nor Navier-Stokes are higher order equations, it is clear that the old
models are incomplete and therefore not capable of describing either the medium
or a fluid accurately. 

Now let's consider the negated definition of the vector LaPlace operator for a
field C:

   - delta(C) = - grad(div(C)) + curl_surface(curl_point(C)),

with C = rho * k * v, resulting in a unit of measurement of:

    [C] = [rho] * [k] * [v] = [kg/m^3] * [m^2/s] * [m/s] = [kg/s^2].

Thus, C represents a thusfar unknown quantity that has a unit of measurement in
[kg/s^2], [N/m], [J/m^2] or [Pa-m]. And since in our model the Ampere
representing electric current also has a unit of measurement in [kg/s^2], we
have chosen to use the symbol C. However, since electric current in our model is
considered to represent turbulence within the medium, it can be speculated that
C also represents some quantity related to turbulence. For now, we shall refer
to C as our primary dynamic field.

From this, we can write out intermediate fields similar to Maxwell's equations,
with the big difference that these intermediate fields are derived from a higher
order equation, unlike Maxwell's:

    phi = div(C) 
    
    A   = curl_point(C)
    
    E  = -grad(phi) 
    
    B  =  curl_surface(A)

And because of vector identities we can also write:    

    curl(E) = 0 
    
    div(B)  = 0,
    
since the divergence of a curl of the gradient of any twice-differentiable
scalar field p is always the zero vector (curl(grad(p))=0), and the divergence
of the curl of any vector field A is always zero as well (div(curl(A))=0).

Thus, we have shown that the fields derived from application of the vector
Laplacian yield a Helmholtz decomposition of the field C, decomposing it into a
divergence free component B and a curl free component E.

From wikipedia:

"In physics and mathematics, in the area of vector calculus, Helmholtz's
theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus, states that
any sufficiently smooth, rapidly decaying vector field in three dimensions can
be resolved into the sum of an irrotational (curl-free) vector field and a
solenoidal (divergence-free) vector field; this is known as the Helmholtz
decomposition or Helmholtz representation. It is named after Hermann von
Helmholtz." 

In other words: the fields we have defined are consistent with the fundamental
theorem of vector calculus.

We can compare this with Maxwell's equations:

    E = -grad(phi) - dA/dt, 
    
    B =  curl(A),
    
    curl(E) = -dB/dt, 
    
    div(B)  =  0,
    
    div(E)  = rho / eps,
    
    curl(B) = mu * J - 1/c^2 * dE/dt,
    
Where obviously the curl of the electric field is not equal zero and therefore
Maxwell's equations are not consistent with the fundamental theorem of vector
calculus: the Helmholtz theorem or Helmholtz decomposition as fundamentally
described by the vector Laplace operator.

In other words: we have shown that Maxwell's equations are mathematically
inconsistent.   

Note that when taking the curl on both sides of this equation:

    E = -grad(phi) - dA/dt, 

we obtain the Maxwell-Faraday equation, representing Faraday's law of induction:

    curl(E) = -dB/dt.

Faraday's law of induction is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a
magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an
electromotive force (EMF), which is thus a law that applies at the macroscopic
level.

An interesting detail is how the fields can be characterizeed in a descretized
version of Maxwell's equations, as can be read further down in this document:

"In electrodynamics, the electric field is located on the edges of the grid
cells, while the magnetic field is located on the faces of the grid cells. This
is because the electric field is a vector field that is defined at a point in
space, while the magnetic field is a vector field that is defined over an area."


This illustrates that geometry with respect to definition of our operators
matters, and since this is correctly implemented in the discretized alrogirims
in this simulator, we should realize that the infenitesimal fields can also
be fundamentally distinguished by fields defined at a point in space and fields
defined over an area.

phi is a point field, while A is a surface field, and E is a point field, while
B is a surface field. This is a very important distinction, because it reveals
that the electric and magnetic fields are fundamentally different types of
vector fields. 

Based on this, what can we conclude about this equation because of the mixture of
point fields defined at a point in space and surface fields defined over an area?

  curl(E) = -dB/dt.
  
@copilot: What are the rules with regards to addition of point and surface fields
and what does this mean for this equation?

GitHub Copilot: In a staggered Yee grid, the fields are located at either integer
or half-integer grid points, whereby the integer grid points represent vector
fields defined at a point in space, while the half-integer grid points represent
vector fields defined over an area. This means that the electric field E is
located at integer grid points and the magnetic field B is located at
half-integer grid points.

In the equation curl(E) = -dB/dt, the curl of the electric field E is a point
field located at integer grid points, while the time derivative of the magnetic
field B is a surface field located at half-integer grid points. This means that
the two fields are defined at different locations on the grid, which is why the
equation is not mathematically consistent.

l4m4re: So, what can we conclude from this?

GitHub Copilot: The equation curl(E) = -dB/dt is not mathematically consistent
because it mixes point fields defined at a point in space with surface fields
defined over an area. In order to make the equation mathematically consistent,
the fields should be defined at the same location on the grid.

Because of the inconsistencies in Maxwell's equations with respect to the
fundamental theorem of vector calculus, it is now clear that this entanglement
of the fundamental E and B fields in Maxwell's equations is responsible for a
lot of problems in current main stream physics, for starters the non-invariance
of Maxwell's equations to the Galilean transform.

This is described by C.K. Thornhill in his paper "Real or Imaginary Space-Time?
Reality or Relativity?":

    https://etherphysics.net/CKT4.pdf   

    "ABSTRACT 

    The real space-time of Newtonian mechanics and the ether concept is
    contrasted with the imaginary space-time of the non-ether concept and
    relativity. In real space-time (x, y, z, ct) characteristic theory shows
    that Maxwell's equations and sound waves in any uniform fluid at rest have
    identical wave surfaces. 

    Moreover, without charge or current, Maxwell's equations reduce to the same
    standard wave equation which governs such sound waves. This is not a general
    and invariant equation but it becomes so by Galilean transformation to any
    other reference-frame. So also do Maxwell's equations which are, likewise,
    not general but unique to one reference-frame. 

    The mistake of believing that Maxwell's equations were invariant led to the
    Lorentz transformation and to relativity; and to the misinterpretation of
    the differential equation for the wave cone through any point as the
    quadratic differential form of a Riemannian metric in imaginary space-time
    (x, y, z, ict). 

    Mathematics is then required to tolerate the same equation being transformed
    in different ways for different applications. Otherwise, relativity is
    untenable and recourse must then be made to real space-time, normal Galilean
    transformation and an ether with Maxwellian statistics and Planck's energy
    distribution."

Yet another problem with Maxwell's equations is that the potential fields phi
and A are not unique, because they are defined as sort of an inverse of E and B,
but are not derived from some primary field like the C field in the new theory.

It is this non-uniqueness of the scalar and vector potentials in Maxwell's
equations that leaves room for "gauge freedom" on top of which a whole set of
"gauge theories" have been built:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory
    
    "The earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was Maxwell's
    formulation, in 1864-65, of electrodynamics ("A Dynamical Theory of the
    Electromagnetic Field") which stated that any vector field whose curl
    vanishes — and can therefore normally be written as a gradient of a function
    — could be added to the vector potential without affecting the magnetic
    field. 
    
    [...]
    
    The importance of gauge theories in physics is exemplified in the tremendous
    success of the mathematical formalism in providing a unified framework to
    describe the quantum field theories of electromagnetism, the weak force and
    the strong force. This theory, known as the Standard Model, accurately
    describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four fundamental
    forces of nature, and is a gauge theory with the gauge group SU(3) x SU(2) x
    U(1). Modern theories like string theory, as well as general relativity,
    are, in one way or another, gauge theories." 
    
Note that because of the vector identity curl(grad(p))=0, addition of a vector
field whose curl vanishes to the vector potential has no effect whatsoever on
the resulting field, which begs the question of why the addition of a vector
field that has no effect on the resulting field, is supposed to descri`be
something that has any relevance to the real world at all.

Or, to put it another way: how exactly is the Standard Model, which is a gauge
theory and therefore uses fields that have no effect on the resulting physical
fields, supposed to have any relevance to the real world at all?

Thus, we can conclude that Maxwell's rather strange entanglement of the electric
and magnetic fields has led to a lot of problems in physics, to such an extent
that it has been accepted that theories that are not only mathematically
inconsistent but also use fields that have no effect on the resulting physical
fields, are completely acceptable and even the norm in physics.


While it is useful to write out intermediate fields similar to Maxwell's
equations for our new theory in order to compare them with Maxwell's equations,
it is also confusing to do so, because even though our intermediate fields are
similar to Maxwell's, they are not the same and should therefore be described
with different symbols.

So let's consider the negated definition of the vector LaPlace operator for a
field C again:

   - delta(C) = - grad(div(C)) + curl_surface(curl_point(C)),

with C = rho * k * v, resulting in a unit of measurement of:

    [C] = [rho] * [k] * [v] = [kg/m^3] * [m^2/s] * [m/s] = [kg/s^2].

From this, we can write out intermediate fields similar to Maxwell's equations,
with completely different meanings and units of measurements:

    p = div(C) 
    
    A = curl_point(C)
    
    L = -grad(p) 
    
    R = curl_surface(A)

And because of vector identities we can also write:    

    curl(L) = 0 
    
    div(B)  = 0,

And since the unit of measurement of C is [kg/s^2], we can work out the units of
measurement of the intermediate fields given that the grad, div and curl
operators all have a unit of measurement in per meter [1/m]:

    [p] = [kg/s^2] * [1/m] = [kg/m-s^2] or [Pa] = [N/m^2] = [J/m^3]  

    [A] = [kg/s^2] * [1/m] = [kg/m-s^2] or [Pa] = [N/m^2] = [J/m^3]
    
    [L] = [kg/m-s^2] * [1/m] = [kg/m^2-s^2] or [Pa/m] = [N/m^3] = [J/m^4]
    
    [R] = [kg/m-s^2] * [1/m] = [kg/m^2-s^2] or [Pa/m] = [N/m^3] = [J/m^4]

Thus we have found that our scalar and vector potentials have a unit in [Pa]
representing pressure, while our resulting [L] and [R] fields have a unit in
[N/m^3] representing force density. And, since [Pa] = [J/m^3], we can also
consider the scalar and vector potentials to represent the energy density of the
medium.

Note that the intermediate fields we have defined are consistent with the
fundamental theorem of vector calculus, unlike Maxwell's equations.

Now let's consider the negated definition of the vector LaPlace operator for a
field I:

   - delta(I) = - grad(div(I)) + curl_surface(curl_point(I)),

with I = rho * k * a, resulting in a unit of measurement of:

    [I] = [rho] * [k] * [a] = [kg/m^3] * [m^2/s] * [m/s^2] = [kg/s^3].

Thus, I represents the Intensity or radiosity field in [kg/s^3], [N/m-s],
[J/m^2-s], [Pa-m/s] or [W/m^2].

From this, we can write out intermediate fields:

    t   = div(I) 
    
    W   = curl_point(I)
    
    Y_l = -grad(t) 
    
    Y_a = curl_surface(W)

And because of vector identities we can also write:    

    curl(Y_l) = 0 
    
    div(Y_a)  = 0, 

And since the unit of measurement of I is [kg/s^3], we can work out the units of
measurement of the intermediate fields:

    [t] = [kg/s^3] * [1/m] = [kg/m-s^3] or [Pa/s] = [W/m^3] = [N/m^2-s] 
    
    [W] = [kg/s^3] * [1/m] = [kg/m-s^3] or [Pa/s] = [W/m^3] = [N/m^2-s] 
        
    [Y_l] = [kg/m-s^3] * [1/m] = [kg/m^2-s^3] or [Pa/m-s] = [N/m^3-s] 
    
    [Y_a] = [kg/m-s^3] * [1/m] = [kg/m^2-s^3] or [Pa/m-s] = [N/m^3-s] 
    

Thus we have found that our second order scalar and vector potentials have a
unit in [W/m^3] representing power density, while our resulting [Y_l] and [Y_a]
fields have a unit in [N/m^3-s] representing yank density, the time derivative
of force density. 

It is not far fetched to assume that the scalar power density field t in [W/m^3]
actually represents temperature, perhaps apart from a constant factor, because
it is a scalar field within a superfluid medium model and the unit of power
density feels like a natural match with temperature, so that temperature
actually is a measurement of power density within the medium. If this is
correct, then there should be no doubt that this model will lead to a much
deeper understanding of temperature and heat related phsyics in general,
especially because we also have the angular counterpart of the scalar potential,
the vector potential field W, which also has a unit of measurement of power
density.

It feels right to associate current density J with the angular power density
field W. However, the unit of measurment of J would be [A/m^3], which would in
our theory be equal to [kg/s-m^3]. 

eta = 1/mu = 1/4*pi*1e-7 = 8.987551787368176e+16 [kg/m-s2] rho = eta/k =
8.987551787368176e+16 [kg/m3]

W in [kg/m-s^3] or [Pa/s] = [W/m^3] = [N/m^2-s] J in [kg/m^3-s] or [A/m^3]

J = W / c^2 ??

Dimensons match:

[kg/m^3-s]  = [kg/m-s^3] / [m^2/s^2] 

            = [kg/m-s^3] * [s^2/m^2] 

            = [kg/m^3-s^3] * [s^2] 
            
            = [kg/m^3-s] 



 
 
So far, we have made a number of references to superfluids, without explaining
what a superfluid actually is. Generally, a superfluid is described as a fluid
that has zero viscosity and therefore flows without friction. However, this is
incorrect. 

An interesting detail is that the intensity field I can also be defined as:

    I = - κ v,

with κ the modulus or elasticity in [Pa] or [kg/m-s2], which has a unit of
measurement that differs by a per second [/s] from the unit of measurement for
viscosity eta in [Pa-s] or [kg/m-s].

This reflects the difference between elastic forces and viscous (shear) forces,
namely that the elastic force is proportional to the amount of deformation,
while the viscous one is proportional to the rate of deformation. 

So, it appears we can conclude that in physical reality there are no actual
static (elastic) forces (at the quantum level) and that deep down there are only
dynamic forces and interactions which are governed by the velocity diffusion
equation (a = dv/dt = -k * delta(v)), whereby what we think to observe as static
elastic forces are in reality the time derivatives of forces that are
fundamentally of a viscous nature.

This is a very interesting conclusion, because it relates nicely to the rather
strange observed behavior of superfluids, which are currently described by a
two-fluid model, whereby the superfluid component is described as a frictionless
fluid, while the normal fluid component is described as a viscous fluid. 

Since within the new model, we have two scalar potentials and two vector
potentials, along with derived force and yank density fields, and we find that
the potentials and yank density fields derived from the intensity field can also
be considered as fields describing elastic forces, it becomes comprehensible
that the current two-fluid model can perhaps be matched to our new model.

Thus, the superfluid component would be described by our primary dynamic field C
and it's derived fields, while the normal fluid component is described by the
intensity field I and its derived fields, of which the scalar potential field p
is very interestng, since we assume that one to represent (a measurement of)
temperature.

This way, we would come to a model whereby elastic behavior (I field and
derived) emerges as function of scalar potential t, which we assume to represent
temperature. Thus, this could explain how normal fluid behavior emerges from
superfluid behavior as temperature rises, which would be a very interesting
result.

One of the most interesting phenomena observed with superfluid is that quantized
vortices arise when a superfluid is rotated, whereby the quantization gamma is
given by:

    gamma = h / m,
    
with h Planck's constant and m the mass of a superfluid particle, such as
superfluid helium.

When we equate this circulatio constant gamma with the quantum circulation
constant k, we can compute the mass of an elemental medium particle along:

    m = h / k = 6.62607015e-34 / 8.987551787368176e+16 = 7.374e-51 [kg],
    
What is very interesting about this result is that we can compute the Compton
wavelength and frequency of this particle along:

    lambda = h / (m * c) = 6.62607015e-34 / (7.374e-51 * 299792458) = 2299792458
    [m].
    
So, for a particle with a mass of 7.374e-51 [kg], we find a Compton wavelength
of 2299792458 [m], which is exactly equal to the speed of light c, but with a
unit of measurement in [m] instead of [m/s].     
 
It should be no surprise that when we compute the Compton frequency of this
particle, we find:

    nu = c / lambda = 299792458 / 2299792458 = 1 [Hz].

This puts serious question marks on the validity of the mass-energy equivalence
principle, since, according to Wikipedia, the Compton wavelength is defined as
the wavelength of a photon whose energy is the same as the rest mass of a
particle.

Are we really to believe that the tiniest of the tiniest particle with a mass of
7.374e-51 [kg], about 20 orders of magnitude lighter than the electron, has a
Compton wavelength of no less than 2299792458 [m] and associated frequency of 1
[Hz]?

And why does this particular mass (7.374e-51 [kg]) has a Compton wavelength that
is exactly equal to the speed of light c? 

It is these questions, along with the mathematical inconsistensies we found in
Maxwell's equations, that reveal that there is something seriously wrong with
the current mainstream models, which not only involves Maxwell's equations and
everything built on top of it, but also the fluid mechanics Navier-Stokes
equations.

Now let's introduce a conversation with CoPilot:
------------------------------------------------

l4m4re: So, if I understand this correctly, in a fluid dynamics Yee grid you
have a scalar field on the edges of the grid  cells and a vector field on the
faces of the grid, while in electrodynamics you have vector fields both on the
edges and on the faces of the grid cells?


GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. In a fluid dynamics Yee grid, the scalar
field is located on the edges of the grid cells, while the vector field is
located on the faces of the grid cells. This is because the scalar field
represents a quantity that is defined at a point in space, while the vector
field represents a quantity that has both magnitude and direction and is defined
over an area.

In electrodynamics, the electric field is located on the edges of the grid
cells, while the magnetic field is located on the faces of the grid cells. This
is because the electric field is a vector field that is defined at a point in
space, while the magnetic field is a vector field that is defined over an area.

Overall, the Yee grid is designed to accurately model the behavior of
electromagnetic waves and fluid flow by discretizing the fields on a staggered
grid with interlaced Yee-coordinates. By using different field representations
and discretization schemes, the Yee grid can be used to simulate a wide range of
physical phenomena in both electrodynamics and fluid dynamics.

This is a very important explanation of the fundamental problem with Maxwell's
equations, because the discretization reveals that there are two fundamentally
different types of vectoer fields, which are:

1) vector fields that are defined at a point in space, such as the electric 
field in electrodynamics and the scalar field in fluid dynamics as well as in
our new superfluid ether theory.

2) vector fields that are defined over an area, such as the magnetic field in
electrodynamics and the vector field in fluid dynamics as well as in our new
superfluid ether theory.

This is a very important distinction, because it reveals that the electric and
magnetic fields are fundamentally different types of vector fields. However,
this goes much further than just Maxwell's or Navier-Stokes equations, because
the distinction ultimately originates at the mathematical definition of the
three fundamental vector operators: grad, div and curl.

These three operators are defined using two methods, namely as a differential
operator and as a finite difference operator. Both the differential and finite
difference operators are defined relative to a certain volume, whereby for the
finite difference operators the volume is discretized into a grid of cells and
therefore has a finite size, while for the differential operators the limit of
the volume is taken to zero and therefore has an infinitesimally small size.

This means that for the differential operators the resulting vector fields can
all be considered to be defined at a point in space, while for the finite
difference operators the resulting vector fields are considered to be located at
specific locations on the grid, such as the faces of the grid cells for the
angular vector fields (curl operator) and the center point of the grid cell for
the linear fields consisting of a scalar (div operator) and a vector component
(grad operator).

In other words: it is the operator used that determines the location of the
resulting vector or scalar field relative to the grid cell and therefore the
type of field, either defined at a point in space (grad, div) or defined over an
area (curl).

In a staggered Yee grid, the fields are located at either integer or
half-integer grid points, whereby the integer grid points represent vector
fields defined at a point in space, while the half-integer grid points represent
vector fields defined over an area, the latter being one of the faces of the
grid cell. 

In other words: in the discretization of a staggered Yee grid each scalar and
vector field is located at a specific location relative to the cube geometry of
the grid cell. Thus, half-integer grid points represent vector fields defined
over an area and therefore a number of cube faces and are therefore located at a
grid face, while integer grid points represent vector fields defined relative to
the center of the cube, which is located half a grid cell away from the faces of
the cube hence the location on a "half-integer grid point" in the arrays used in
simulation software to represent the finite difference fields.

So, let us consider the definition of the three operators relative to the
geometry over which they are defined and compare the differential and finite
difference methods. In principle, the differential operators can be considered
as also being defined relative to a grid, even though the limit of the grid
spacing is taken to zero. This means that the limitations of the finite
difference operators also apply to the differential operators and a clear
distinction needs to be made between vector fields defined at a point in space
and vector fields defined over an area.

The divergence operator is defined as the surface integral of the flux of a
vector field over a closed surface. For the differential operator, the surface
integral is taken over a surface of an arbitrary volume around some point in
space, like a sphere or a cube, of which the limit is taken to zero. The
resulting vector is then located at the center of the volume, which is a point
in space. Since in a staggered Yee grid a discretized cube is used, we can
consider the differential operators to be defined over a cube of infinitesimally
small but not zero size. 

So, if we consider the divergence operator, we can see that it is defined as a
surface integral over the area of all the faces of a cube, divided by the volume
of the cube, resulting in a unit of per meter [1/m] for the operator. Since the
resulting value is not located on one of the faces of the cube, it can be
considered to be located at the center of the cube, which is a point in space.
Since fields defined at a point in space are represented by integer grid points
in a staggered Yee grid, the resulting scalar field is located at an integer
grid point.

While the gradient operator can be defined in multiple ways, including for
vector fields resulting in a tensor, we will only consider the gradient of a
scalar field here. 

The gradient of a scalar field is defined as the spatial derivative of the
scalar field with respect to the three spatial dimensions. For the differential
operator, the derivative is taken relative to a point in space, while for the
finite difference operator the derivative is taken relative to the grid spacing.

So, the difference of the scalar field is computed between six points at a
certain distance from the point along the three coordinate axes (+ and -), which
are added together and divided by the distance, resulting in a unit of per meter
[1/m] for the operator. In the discretized implementation, the result is not
actually divided by the grid spacing, because it is an actual difference
relative to the grid. 

Since the resulting value is not located on one of the faces of the cube, it can
be considered to be located at the center of the cube, which is a point in
space. Since fields defined at a point in space are represented by integer grid
points in a staggered Yee grid, the resulting vector field is located at an
integer grid point as is the input scalar field.

For the curl operator, we found that we needed two different curl operators,
namely the point and surface curl operators. The curl operator is defined as the
line integral of the tangential component of the vector field over a closed path
around some point in space, divided by the area enclosed by the path along
Stokes' theorem, resulting in a unit of per meter [1/m] for the operator. And
since this line integral can be computed clockwise or counter-clockwise, we
obtain the point and surface curl operators needed in the implementation of the
staggered Yee grid.


GitHub Copilot (edited): In a staggered Yee grid implementation, the grid
spacing is constant, which means that the ratio between the grid spacing and the
area and volume of a grid cube is also constant. This allows for simplifications
in the finite difference implementation of the gradient and curl operators, as
the difference of the scalar field can be computed between six points at a
certain distance from the point along the three coordinate axes (+ and -).

Similarly, the point and surface curl operators can be computed by taking the
difference of the vector field components at neigboring faces along the three
coordinate axes (+ and -). Since the grid spacing is constant, the resulting
value is simply the difference between the vector field components at the two
neighboring grid points located at half-integer grid points since these fields
are defined over an area.


Therefore, in the implementation of the gradient and curl operators in a
staggered Yee grid, the grid spacing can be assumed to be 1.0, which simplifies
the computation of the operators using finite differences. This eliminates the
need for integrals and allows for a consistent and accurate computation using
finite differences.

-:-

So, for fields defined over an area, half-integer grid points are used, which
are not actually points, but represent te surface area of the face of the grid
cell. And for fields defined at a point in space, integer grid points are used,
which are actual points. This is the essence of the staggered Yee grid, and
therefore point fields and area fields are fundamentally different types of
fields, which cannot be mixed.

So, let's consider the Maxwell-Faraday equation:

    curl(E) = -dB/dt.
    
This equation is defined relative to a point in space, because the curl operator
is defined relative to a point in space. This means that the electric field E is
defined relative to a point in space, which means that it is a point field and
therefore should be represented by an integer grid point.

However, the magnetic field B is defined relative to an area, because the
derivative of the magnetic field is taken relative to the grid spacing, which
means that it is a surface field and therefore should be represented by a
half-integer grid point.

So, the Maxwell-Faraday equation is fundamentally flawed, because it mixes a
point field with a surface field, which is not allowed in a staggered Yee grid.

So, let's consider the Maxwell-Ampere equation: 

    curl(B) = mu * J - 1/c^2 * dE/dt,
    
This equation is defined relative to a point in space, because the curl operator
is defined relative to a point in space. This means that the magnetic field B is
defined relative to a point in space, which means that it is a point field and
therefore should be represented by an integer grid point.

However, the current density J is defined relative to an area, because the
derivative of the current density is taken relative to the grid spacing, which
means that it is a surface field and therefore should be represented by a
half-integer grid point.

So, the Maxwell-Ampere equation is fundamentally flawed, because it mixes a
point field with a surface field, which is not allowed in a staggered Yee grid.

So, let's consider the Maxwell-Gauss equation:

    div(E)  = rho / eps,
    
This equation is defined relative to a point in space, because the divergence
operator is defined relative to a point in space. This means that the electric
field E is defined relative to a point in space, which means that it is a point
field and therefore should be represented by an integer grid point.

However, the charge density rho is defined relative to an area, because the
derivative of the charge density is taken relative to the grid spacing, which
means that it is a surface field and therefore should be represented by a
half-integer grid point.

So, the Maxwell-Gauss equation is fundamentally flawed, because it mixes a point
field with a surface field, which is not allowed in a staggered Yee grid.




GitHub Copilot: Thank you for the clarification. You are correct that the
magnetic field `B` is defined relative to an area, and is therefore a surface
field. The derivative of the magnetic field `B` is taken relative to the grid
spacing, which means that it should be represented by a half-integer grid point.

In the Yee grid implementation, the magnetic field `H` is defined on the edges
of the grid cells, which are integer grid points, while the auxiliary magnetic
field `B` is defined on the faces of the grid cells, which are half-integer grid
points. This is because the `H` field is related to the current density, which
is a point quantity, while the `B` field is related to the magnetic flux
density, which is a surface quantity.

-:-

This, however is inconsistent. The thinking error is that current density can be
considered a point quantity, while in reality current always follows a closed
loop and is therefore a surface quantity.

So, let's consider the Maxwell-Ampere equation again:
    
        curl(B) = mu * J - 1/c^2 * dE/dt,
        
Copilot: This equation is defined relative to a point in space, because the curl
operator is defined relative to a point in space. This means that the magnetic
field B is defined relative to a point in space, which means that it is a point
field and therefore should be represented by an integer grid point.

This, however, is incorrect. Yes, in infinitesimal consideration, one can
consider the curl operator to be defined relative to a point in space, but that
is misleading, since the curl operator is defined relative to a closed path,
which is a surface quantity. So, the point is that even when taking the limit of
the path to zero, it still is a path and not a point in space.

Thus, we come to the conclusion that both the H and B fields should be defined
relative to a surface, which means that they should be represented by a
half-integer grid point.
